1.) See helloworld.c and video
2.) A pointer variable is any variable that points to an address in memory. A regular non-pointer variable stores any value that is not an address.
3.) Compiled code is code that needs to be compiled into machine code before hand to run. Interpreted code is interpreted during runtime and turned into machine code as it goes.
4.) (a) 0x1E
        Binary: 0001 1110
        Decimal: 030
        MSB: 0
    (b) 0x32
        Binary: 0011 0010
        Decimal: 050
        MSB: 0
    (c) 0xFE
        Binary: 1111 1110
        Decimal: 254
        MSB: 1
    (d) 0xC4
        Binary: 1100 0100
        Decimal: 196
        MSB: 1


6.) 524,288 bits
7.) (a) 107
    (b) 53
    (c) 61
    (d) 63
8.) unsigned char = 0 to 225
    short = -32,768 to 32,767
    double = about 2.3 * 10^-308 to 1.7 * 10^308

10.) unsigned types do not take into account two's complement and therefore do not have any negative numbers. Signed numbers do have two's complement and so both negative and 
positive numbers can be represented.
11.)
    (a) chars vs. ints: In integer math, ints give you a bigger range than chars so you can do operations with much larger numbers than chars. The main advantage of chars over ints
    is that chars only take up one byte while ints take up four.
    (b) floats vs. doubles: Doubles are more precise than floats since they can represent more decimal points. Doubles are eight bytes and floats are four bytes. Doubles are thus
    more expensive than floats.
    (c) chars vs. floats: Floats give much more precision than chars. The main advantage of chars over floats is that chars take up less memory than floats.

16.) An unsigned long would be the closest to an eight byte pointer. An unsigned long is also 8 bytes and its minimum value is also 0, similar to an 8 byte pointer. 
17.) 
    (a) unknown
    (b) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        all others the same 
    (c) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        Same as before, j still unknown
    (d) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        0xAE stored at 0xB0...0xB3
    (e) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        0xB0 stored at 0xB9
        0xAE stored at 0xB0...0xB3
    (f) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        0xB0 stored at 0xB9
        0x12 stored at 0xB0...0xB3
    (g) 0xB0 stored at 0xB8
        0xB0 stored at 0xB9
        0x12 stored at 0xB0...0xB3
        0x12 stored at 0xB4...0xB7
