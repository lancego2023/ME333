3.) Pin 12 is an analog input, comparator, change notification input, and a digital I/O. Pin 12 is not 5V Tolerant

4.) TRIS is the register that determines if a pin is input or output.

5.) 0x00C3

6.) SYSCLK: clock for the system
    PBCLK: clock for the peripheral bus
    PORTA-G: Digital I/O Ports, from 0v to 3.3v. PORTB allows for analog input.
    Timer1-5: 16-bit counters/timers that count the pulse from a signal. Can be used to count time.
    10-bit ADC: Takes analog signals and converts them to digital signals.
    PWM OC1-5: Can generate pulse width modulated signals.
    Data RAM: Stores temporary data, lost when the PIC32 is turned off.
    Program Flash Memory: Memory made to store program; slow but non volatile.
    Prefetch Cache Module: Stores recently executed program instructions that will be executed again.

7.) Not clocked by PBCLK: Interrupt Priority Controller, USB, CAN, ETHERNET, DMAC, ICD

8.) 0.00322265625 V (3.3/1024)

9.) 256 bytes

10.) The datapath is 128-bits wide so it can keep up with the bandwidth to the CPU, which is 32 bits wide but runs 
4 times as fast.

11.) Digital I/O can be configured to be an open drain. When set as an ipen drain, the pin has up to a 5.5V pull up and the I/O
can toggle between the 4 V or to sink and go down to 0 V.

12.) Max amount of flash memory: 2800000 
    Max amount of RAM: 1D000000

13.)
    (a) bit 13-12, 01
    (b) bit 23, bit 20-16, 10100
    (c) bit 2-0
