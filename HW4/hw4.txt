3.4) See simplePIC4.c

3.5) See demonstration video. simplePIC5.c is also attached.

4.1) In NU32.c, the functions NU32_startup, NU32_readUART3, and NU32_writeUART3 are all meant to be used in other C files. 
    NU32_LED1, NU32_LED2, and NU32_USER are also meant to be used by other C files. NU32_DESIRED_BAUD is meant only for
    NU32.c since the baud rate is something you would likely not change. NU32_SYS_FREQ could be used by other C files, but
    likely won't be.

4.2) For PART A: see invest.c
    For PART B: see helper.c, helper.h, main.c
    For PART C: see helperc.h, calculate.c, io.c, main_c.c

4.4) See demonstration video.
